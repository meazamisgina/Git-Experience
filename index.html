    <p>Hello, my name is Meaza Misgina and I am from Tigray, Ethiopia. I am currently learning at the AkiraChix  CodeHive program. It has been almost three weeks since I joined the program and I'm here to share with you my experience during these weeks; and I am really grateful to the AkiraChix community  for allowing me to join the tech world by believing in my abilities.</p>

    <h2 style ="color: darkblue">Not So Good Experiences</h2><br>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Limited Practice Time After Class</h3>After classes end, we have limited time to stay in the lab/classroom to practice on our own. While this encourages us to use our time efficiently, it can be challenging until we adapt to managing our time effectively.</li>
        <li><h3>Time Management Challenges</h3>Managing time effectively to meet project deadlines can be difficult, especially when we're still adjusting to the program's pace. It requires discipline and planning, which can be stressful until we get into a rhythm</li>
    </ul>
